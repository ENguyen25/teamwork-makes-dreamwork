# Team Profile Generator

## Description
In order to create team profiles, it can get repetitive. I decided to create this generator so people can use it to make team profiles quickly and easily.   

Through this project, I learned how to use Inquirer, and improved my proficiency in Node.js. This profile generator uses Bulma to seamlessly create well-styled websites with only a few lines of code. It also allows for users to create as many profiles as needed through a user-friendly loop of prompts.


## Usage
1. Download the package of files.
2. Install NPM.
3. Execute the index.js file with Node.
